- Clean, modern interface with smooth hover effects
- Three main sections:
  - About Me (personal introduction)
  - Technical Skills (cybersecurity competencies)
  - Contact (interactive form)
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- CSS animations and transitions

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including CSS Grid for skills layout)

- Secondary: `lightcyan` (accent color)

## Installation

No installation required - this is a static website. Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

1. Navigate through the site using the header menu
2. View Guenda's background and interests in the About section
3. Check out technical skills in the Skills section

## Customization

To customize this portfolio for your own use:

1. Replace the personal information in the HTML file
